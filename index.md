Hello there!

My name is China and I'm a software developer at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com). I recently made it through the [Associate Consultant Program](https://info.thoughtworks.com/graduates), a 24-month program designed for new grads and those new to the software industry. If that sounds like it's for you, feel free to [reach out](mailto:hello@chinaowl.co) and ask me about it! You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/china_owl).

I like working on front-end stuff. I enjoy working closely with UX and UI designers to bring their designs to life with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am currently:

- Trying to figure out if I can make it to [CSS Dev Conf](http://2016.cssdevconf.com)
- Working through some courses on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com)
- Attempting to complete [a side project or two](/projects) and contribute to open source

Sometimes I write about front-end development and the things I've learned. You can find my blog [right here](/writing)! I recently migrated from Tumblr to Jekyll.

In my free time, I like to play video games such as Heroes of the Storm, Fire Emblem, and Animal Crossing. I'm also learning how to make graphics. You can follow my (slow) progress on my [super fancy art blog](http://china-owl-art.tumblr.com). And since I never stick with one hobby for very long, I'm also learning how to play the ukulele.

Thanks for stopping by!

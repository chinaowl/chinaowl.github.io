Some time ago, I read [this blog post](http://ryanbosinger.com/blog/2015/01/06/keep-your-sanity-with-a-work-diary.html) about keeping a work diary. The idea (as I interpreted it) is to write down work-related stuff throughout the day, whether it’s things you did, things you learned, or useful links you found.

Seeing as my days have all blended together into one giant blur (and I’ve only been working for a little over a year), I decided to give it a try. My hope was to be able to feel accomplished at the end of every day, rather than only remembering the big moments.

I’ve been testing out the [Ulysses writing app](http://www.ulyssesapp.com) for quite some time (that ten hour trial lasts forever when you aren’t writing as often as you should), so I created a new sheet and started logging my days.

That was a month ago. (Wow, another month already?!) Like with all of my journals/diaries/blogs, I started out strong with at least five bullet points a day. Towards the end of the month, I only recorded one bullet point a day. (Not to mention the few days I wrote nothing at all.)

Here are some excerpts (completely unedited):

* discovered that percentages + cascade = annoying to deal with (i.e., text ends up being extra small due to percentages being applied twice)
* learned about `webkit-tap-highlight-color` which controls the color of the tap area in mobile
* got confused about `git rebase`
* unproductive day
* learned about Bourbon, a mixin library for Sass that does vendor prefixes and other stuff for you
* how do you do animations in CSS blargh
* remembered the importance of `<meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` to get responsive pages to display correctly in devices
* view an old commit with `git checkout COMMIT_NUMBER`
* picked up a defect so I got to code and make a pull request! yay!
* half hour stand up whyyy

Some thoughts: I wish I had done a better job of keeping up with it. Reading through it now, I can see it becoming a personal wiki that I can search through in the future when I’m trying to remember something I know I’ve seen or done before.

However, I am uncertain about the format. Keeping everything in one file is probably going to become unwieldy and I’d like to be able to access it anywhere. Maybe a private GitHub repo? But it is nice to be able to search everything at once. I’ll have to think about it.

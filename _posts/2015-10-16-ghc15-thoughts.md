Too tired to form complete sentences.

* Houston is hot! Even Arizona is nicer this time of year. I think.
* I was sick the entire time. Tried not to cough on anyone.
* Also tried not to annoy people during talks with my coughing.
* Did not get to go to many talks due to spending time at the TW booth and being sick.
* But I did enjoy Hilary Mason’s keynote on day one and Brianna Wu’s talk.
* Brianna’s talk = depressing + inspiring. Loved how she answered questions at the end and told each and every one of them, “You’re awesome. Keep going.”
* Swag bag was okay. I’m only keeping the stickers, temporary tattoos, lip balm, and stain remover. And maybe the earbuds.
* Met a lot of TWers from other offices!
* A lot of TWers gave talks and I wish I could have gone to all of them.
* Got a super cool jacket from TW! We got a lot of compliments.
* Our booth was really awesome too. Pictures with Grace Hopper herself, backwards clocks.
* I did some pairing at our kata stations, which was fun.
* Talked to a lot of people on the first day. On the second day my voice was dead. Came back for a bit on the third day.
* Ran into two fellow former UA section leaders! Wish we could have gotten a picture together.
* Did pairing interviews for the first time.
* I refrained from collecting ALL THE SWAG and just grabbed a tote bag from Slack because it was cute.
* Conference food was terribad.
* Dance partayyy tonight!

Update:

* So…I only have my memory of the 2012 Baltimore dance party to compare tonight’s dance party to, and the 2012 was waaay better. Mostly because of the venue. Science museum &gt; baseball stadium.
* It was so incredibly hot and humid in the stadium. No AC, no airflow.
* A bottle of water cost $6.50!!!
* Dance floor was laughably small.
* Giveaways at the beginning felt very…corporate?
* Once the actual dancing started, it got better. Mostly because I got to see Telle Whitney (CEO of ABI) dance in a neck brace with TW’s own CTO, Rebecca Parsons.
* What was the big surprise? I’m guessing not Taylor Swift.
* The real fun was had at TW’s after party. Who knew karaoke was the cure for a sore throat and persistent cough? But really. I had so much fun.

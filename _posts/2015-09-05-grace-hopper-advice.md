I went to the [Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing](http://gracehopper.org) (GHC) in 2012 in Baltimore, Maryland when I was a junior in college. It was one of the best experiences of my life, and I wouldn’t be where I am today without it. Literally. Before the GHC career fair, I had never heard of [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com) (the company I now work for). I remember being drawn to their table by the bright colors and free pins. They didn’t offer internships so I couldn’t apply just yet, but I handed a recruiter my resume and a year later, they contacted me about applying for a full-time position. This year I’m so excited to be attending GHC in Houston, with a bunch of fellow ThoughtWorkers! I will probably be working at the career fair the whole time. It’s going to be a lot of fun sitting on the other side of the table.

So, I wanted to share some advice for new GHC attendees, mostly geared towards students who are looking for internships or jobs. Past me has already written two posts about GHC. [The first one](https://codingowl.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/a-review-of-ghc-2012-alternate-title-the-longest-blog-entry-i-will-ever-write/) is a detailed log of every session I attended in 2012. (I’m really happy that past me did this.) [The second](https://codingowl.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/grace-hopper-tips/) consists of tips for success. They are all still relevant, so I’m going to include them in the list below.

* Look for scholarships to cover the cost of attendance! I did not do very much research on this topic when I paid for my own registration in 2012. The number of students walking around with the “Scholarship Recipient” ribbon on their badges made me realize that there are a lot of scholarships out there, from [the official one](http://anitaborg.org/awards-grants/ghc-scholarship-grants/) sponsored by the Anita Borg Institute to the ones sponsored by various companies. You can (and should) also ask your computer science department to see if and how they can help you get funded. Begin your search early--for next year’s GHC, that probably means late winter/early spring 2016.

* Check out the [schedule](http://schedule.gracehopper.org) beforehand. The sessions are organized by clusters and tracks. I know, it's overwhelming--just look at the length of that page. For now, just try to pick out sessions that look interesting or useful to you and narrow it down from there. Definitely attend the keynotes. The career fair lasts for all three days, so clear some room in your schedule for that. Don't feel like you have to do everything--there are people will take notes and blog about the sessions they attended so you can always catch up on the ones you missed later.

* Polish up your resume for the career fair and bring lots of copies! Also, [submit your resume](http://gracehopper.org/resume-database/) to the official database before you arrive. A lot of companies will do interviews at GHC, and submitting your resume early helps them with scheduling.

* Leave some room in your suitcase for the boatloads of swag you're going to collect.

* Wear good shoes. You’ll be doing a LOT of walking around a giant convention center. Don’t be like me and bring only one pair of shoes with zero support--your feet will hate you by the end of day one.

* Bring business cards! If everyone did this, networking would be so much easier. No more pulling out your phone and awkwardly asking for an email address or a phone number–just slide over your card. You might want to check out [MOO](http://www.moo.com/us/products/business-cards.html) for professional, stylish, and affordable options.

* You might get the chance to interview for an internship or job while you're there, either from submitting your resume to the database or just from talking to people at the career fair. So be prepared for a technical interview! I know this might seem impossible with everything else that's going on, so just do your best.

* When they say you don’t have to dress up for an interview, you probably still want to look nice. I had a Microsoft interview that I didn’t think about much beforehand, and I wound up going to my interview wearing jeans and a Wildcats sweatshirt. Now, looking back, I wish I had put more effort into my appearance because it definitely would have helped my confidence level.

* Stay for the dance on Friday night. IT WILL BE AWESOME. In 2012, it was at a science museum with dinosaurs, so it was basically the coolest thing ever.

* Obligatory: have fun!

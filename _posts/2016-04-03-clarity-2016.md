[Clarity](http://clarityconf.com), a conference about style guides and design systems, was held in San Francisco on March 31 and April 1. I decided to go as soon as I saw the impressive speaker list, and now I can say I’m really glad I went.

Videos of the talks will be available in six months, but that’s kind of a long time so I’m posting all my notes here.

The conference was held at the [Alamo Drafthouse](https://drafthouse.com) in the Mission. The chairs were super comfortable and the food was excellent.

Swag overview: postcards, pins, stickers, notebooks, a pencil, and a bag.

The entire conference was put together by [Jina](https://twitter.com/jina). (Thank you, Jina!) The emcee was [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) of CSS-Tricks and CodePen. [Susan](https://twitter.com/bysusanlin) was the official sketchnote artist and you can [see her work here](http://sketch.bysusanlin.com/tagged/sketchnotes).

Now onto the fun stuff! Here’s a list of links to each talk, because otherwise this post would be massive.
